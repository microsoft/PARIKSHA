            "score": 0,
            "justification": "The response is not linguistically acceptable. It lacks clear syntactic structure and is repetitive. The same phrases are repeated multiple times without any context or meaning. This makes the response hard to understand and does not provide a clear answer to the question asked. The response also does not provide information on the places from where the wari comes to Pandharpur which was asked in the question. Therefore, the score is 0."
