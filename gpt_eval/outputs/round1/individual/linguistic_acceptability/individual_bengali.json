For example, the phrase 'বমের সুবিধা' (benefits of bomb) and 'সমস্তক' (all-in-one) are not appropriate in the context of cryptocurrency investment. Also, the response is somewhat repetitive, mentioning 'পুলিশের অনুপযাগ বা নেতৃতার অনিশ্চয়তা' (police follow-up or leadership uncertainty) under both risks and benefits, which doesn't make sense.

            "justification": "The response is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary. However, it is overly verbose and repetitive, which makes it sound stilted. The same sentence is repeated multiple times without adding any new information or context. This repetition does not contribute to the overall understanding of the topic and reduces the fluency of the response."
