            "justification": "The response provided by the model partially aligns with the prompt. It correctly identifies who built the Chettiar Chathiram in Kasi and why it was built. It also provides the distance between the Chathiram and the Kasi Viswanathar temple. However, it does not fully explain the historical connection between the Chathiram and the temple, which was specifically asked for in the prompt. Therefore, the response misses out on some finer details and nuances of the prompt, warranting a score of 1."
